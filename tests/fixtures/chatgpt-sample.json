Here are some ways to develop your mage character while subverting the chosen one trope:\n\n**Give her agency and choice:**\n- Instead of destiny forcing her hand, let her actively choose to pursue or reject her forbidden magic\n- Show her making difficult decisions that have real consequences\n- Let her fail sometimes and learn from those failures\n\n**Develop her internal conflicts:**\n- Why is the magic forbidden? Does she agree with those reasons?\n- What does she sacrifice to learn this magic?\n- How does it affect her relationships with friends and family?\n\n**Make her relatable:**\n- Give her mundane problems alongside the magical ones\n- Show her everyday skills and interests outside of magic\n- Let her have flaws and blind spots that create realistic obstacles\n\n**Focus on her growth:**\n- Start with what she wants vs. what she thinks she wants\n- Show how her understanding of herself and her world evolves\n- Make her journey about becoming who she chooses to be, not fulfilling a prophecy\n\nWhat specific aspects of her personality or backstory are you most interested in developing?"]

Her magic is forbidden because it involves communicating with spirits of the dead, which the magical council considers dangerous and corrupting. I want her to discover that maybe the council isn't entirely wrong - the magic does have a cost. But she's driven by a desperate need to contact her deceased mother who died when she was young. How can I balance making her sympathetic while showing the real dangers of what she's doing?"]

          "parts": ["Perfect setup! The personal motivation makes her much more compelling than a chosen one. Here's how to balance sympathy with real consequences:\n\n**Show gradual costs:**\n- Start small: maybe the magic makes her tired, gives her nightmares, or makes her feel disconnected from the living\n- Escalate slowly: perhaps she begins to see/hear spirits when she doesn't want to, or struggles to distinguish between living people and spirits\n- Consider emotional costs: becoming obsessed with the past at the expense of present relationships\n\n**Make the council's perspective understandable:**\n- Show other necromancers who've been consumed by their magic\n- Reveal that the spirits don't always tell the truth or have good intentions\n- Maybe some spirits are trapped and suffering, and contacting them prolongs their pain\n\n**Create moral complexity:**\n- What if contacting her mother helps solve a current crisis?\n- What if her mother's spirit doesn't want to be contacted?\n- What if the magic could help other grieving people, but at what cost?\n\n**Show her awareness growing:**\n- Let her rationalize the early warning signs\n- Have her notice the changes in herself but struggle to stop\n- Show moments where she questions whether her mother would approve of what she's becoming\n\nThe key is making readers understand her choice while also feeling the weight of what she's risking. What draws you to necromancy as her forbidden magic specifically?"]

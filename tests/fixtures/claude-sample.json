Can you help me make it less stilted?\n\nSARAH enters the coffee shop and spots MIKE at a corner table.\n\nSARAH: Hello Michael. It has been quite some time since we last spoke.\n\nMIKE: Indeed it has, Sarah. I was not expecting to encounter you here.\n\nSARAH: Yes, this is quite the coincidence. How have you been faring?\n\nMIKE: I have been well, thank you for inquiring. And yourself?",

Here's a revised version that feels more authentic:\n\n**SARAH** enters the coffee shop and spots **MIKE** at a corner table. She freezes for a moment, then approaches.\n\n**SARAH:** Mike? Oh my god, is that really you?\n\n**MIKE:** (looking up, surprised) Sarah! What are the odds? \n\n**SARAH:** (laughing nervously) Right? I almost didn't recognize you without the... (gestures at his face) the beard's new.\n\n**MIKE:** (touching his beard self-consciously) Yeah, well, you know. Midlife crisis and all that. You look... wow, you look exactly the same.\n\n**SARAH:** (sitting down across from him) Liar. But I'll take it.\n\n**Key changes I made:**\n- Added realistic interruptions and overlapping thoughts\n- Used contractions and casual language\n- Included physical actions and gestures\n- Added subtext (nervousness, self-consciousness)\n- Made them sound like actual friends with shared history\n- Gave them distinct speaking patterns\n\nWould you like me to help with more of the scene, or do you have other dialogue that needs work?",

          "content": "Absolutely! Addressing the elephant in the room should feel uncomfortable and real. Here's how they might tackle it:\n\n**MIKE:** So... how long has it been? Three years? Four?\n\n**SARAH:** (fidgeting with her coffee cup) Try six. \n\n**MIKE:** Jesus. Six years.\n\n**SARAH:** Yeah.\n\n(Awkward pause. MIKE clears his throat.)\n\n**MIKE:** Look, Sarah, about what happened—\n\n**SARAH:** (quickly) We don't have to do this now.\n\n**MIKE:** Don't we though? I mean, we're sitting here pretending like...\n\n**SARAH:** Like we're normal people having a normal conversation?\n\n**MIKE:** (small laugh) Yeah. That.\n\n**SARAH:** Maybe that's enough for now. Maybe we just... I don't know, exist in the same space for five minutes without everything being about...\n\n**MIKE:** About the wedding.\n\n**SARAH:** (winces slightly) Yeah.\n\n**Notice how:**\n- They dance around the real issue before naming it\n- Sarah tries to avoid the conversation entirely\n- The pauses and interruptions show their discomfort\n- When the \"wedding\" is finally mentioned, it has weight\n- Neither explains exactly what happened—the audience will figure it out\n- Their different approaches (Mike wants to address it, Sarah wants to avoid it) show character\n\nThe key is letting the subtext do most of the work. What do you think happened at this wedding?",
